									localStorage and sessionStorage are relatively new APIs
									(meaning, not all legacy browsers will support them) and are
									near identical (both in APIs and capabilities) with the sole
									exception of persistence. sessionStorage (as the name
									suggests) is only available for the duration of the browser
									session (and is deleted when the tab or window is closed) - it
									does, however, survive page reloads (source DOM Storage guide
									- Mozilla Developer Network). Clearly, if the data you are
									storing needs to be available on an ongoing basis then
									localStorage is preferable to sessionStorage - although you
									should note both can be cleared by the user so you should not
									rely on the continuing existence of data in either case.
									localStorage and sessionStorage are perfect for persisting
									non-sensitive data needed within client scripts between pages
									(for example: preferences, scores in games). The data stored
									in localStorage and sessionStorage can easily be read or
									changed from within the client/browser so should not be relied
									upon for storage of sensitive or security-related data within
									applications.

									Function Scope: When a variable is declared inside a function,

									The Event Loop has one simple job â€” to monitor the Call Stack
									and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, the Event
									Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it
									to the Call Stack, which effectively runs it. Such an
									iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop.
